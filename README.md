A local multiplayer Texas Hold'em Poker app. You get the chips, we take care of the cards. A host device (TV, tablet, etc.) is needed for everyone to view community cards. Players receive cards on their individual devices.

How to run:
In HOME directory:
```bash
sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
git clone https://github.com/havesomepham/pokerparty.git
cd ~/pokerparty
npm install
sudo ng serve
```
